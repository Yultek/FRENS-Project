## NPC Character Development  
### Welcome to the FRENS project, an initiative to create character building tools for Mona worlds. The metaverse can be a lonely place, and we believe that creating lifelike and interactive Non-Player Characters (NPCs) can change the way we interact with these builds. Even basic NPCs can bring a space to life, creating a truly immersive three-dimensional experience that can be both cinematic and educational.

## Outcomes  
**Research and compile resources for generating animated NPCs**  
	-Develop a Github/Google Doc for access to all resources and assets  
	-Hire part time consultation and support  
	-Research the history, terminology, and types of NPCs for professional game development  
	-Compile resources on character templates and information on weight map transfers and more.  
	-Research and test animation tools in Unity:   
-Reactor tools/triggers,   
-Navmesh Agent integration  
-Test creating enemies and animated obstacles, general background characters, and “dependant” NPC sidekicks.  


**-Develop NPC Templates**  
-Create and test 3 different rigging types: humanoid, 4 legged, and custom rigged model  
-Generate 8+ low poly custom 3D models - fully textured and rigged.  
	-Compile resources on character templates and information on weight map transfers and more.  
	-Develop custom animation sequences and compile resources for animation presets.  
		-Create a collection of animations for NPCs: Idle, walk, run, misc behaviors  
	-Test VRM imports and techniques for easily utilizing your VRM designs as NPCs.  

**Create an NPC Community Asset Pack**  
-All model templates will be preset with a bank of interactive features/animations (idle>interaction>idle)  
-Instructions and inventory of how to customize the Unity Package/Reactor  

-Animated Humanoid NPC  
	-Asset pack with 3-5 ready-made humanoid characters  
	-Rigged, fully textured  
	-Inventory of compatible animations  

--Animated 4-legged custom-rigged NPC  
	-Asset pack with 2-3 ready-made 4-legged characters  
	-Rigged, fully textured  
	-Inventory of compatible animations  

--Animated robot custom-rigged NPC  
	-Asset pack with 2 ready-made robot characters  
	-Inventory of compatible animations
