# FRENS-Project
NPC Character Development
Welcome to the FRENS project, an initiative to create character building tools for Mona worlds. The metaverse can be a lonely place, and we believe that creating lifelike and interactive Non-Player Characters (NPCs) can change the way we interact with these builds. Even basic NPCs can bring a space to life, creating a truly immersive three-dimensional experience that can be both cinematic and educational.
