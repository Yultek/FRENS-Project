## NPC Character Development  
### Welcome to the FRENS project, an initiative to create character building tools for Mona worlds. The metaverse can be a lonely place, and we believe that creating lifelike and interactive Non-Player Characters (NPCs) can change the way we interact with these builds. Even basic NPCs can bring a space to life, creating a truly immersive three-dimensional experience that can be both cinematic and educational.

## Outcomes  
### **Research and compile resources for generating animated NPCs**  
- Develop a Github/Google Doc for access to all resources and assets  
- Hire part time consultation and support.  
- Research the history, terminology, and types of NPCs for professional game development  
- Compile resources on character templates and information on weight map transfers and more.  
- Research and test animation tools in Unity:   
- Reactor tools/triggers,   
- Navmesh Agent integration  
- Test creating enemies and animated obstacles, general background characters, and “dependant” NPC sidekicks.

### **Develop NPC Templates**  
- Create and test 2 different rigging types: humanoid, and custom rigged model  
- Generate 4+ low poly custom 3D models - fully textured and rigged.  
- Compile resources on character templates and information on weight map transfers and more.  
- Develop custom animation sequences and compile resources for animation presets.  
- Create a collection of animations for NPCs: Idle, walk, run, misc behaviors  
- Test VRM imports and techniques for easily utilizing your VRM designs as NPCs.  

### **Create an NPC Community Asset Pack**  
- All model templates will be preset with a bank of interactive features/animations (idle>interaction1>interaction2>idle)  
- Written nstructions and inventory of how to customize the Unity Package/Reactor/VS templates

- Animated Humanoid NPC  
	- Asset pack with 1-2 ready-made humanoid characters  
	- Rigged, fully textured  
	- Inventory of compatible animations  


- Animated robot custom-rigged NPC  
	- Asset pack with 1-2 ready-made robot characters  
	- - Rigged, fully textured  
	- Inventory of compatible animations  


### **Written tutorials on each step of the process**  
- Character modeling/ Rigging  
- Animating and importing animations in Blender  
- Importing and optimizing for Unity  
- Utilizing the Unity Animator, VRM and Reactor tools  
- Importing into Mona Space and testing full functions
