## NPC Character Development  
### Welcome to the FRENS project, an initiative to create character building tools for Mona worlds. The metaverse can be a lonely place, and we believe that creating lifelike and interactive Non-Player Characters (NPCs) can change the way we interact with these builds. Even basic NPCs can bring a space to life, creating a truly immersive three-dimensional experience that can be both cinematic and educational.

## Outcomes  
### **Research and compile resources for generating animated NPCs**  
- Develop a Github/Google Doc for access to all resources and assets  
- Hire part time consultation and support.  
- Research the history, terminology, and types of NPCs for professional game development  
- Compile resources on character templates and information on weight map transfers and more.  
- Research and test animation tools in Unity:   
- Reactor tools/triggers,   
- Navmesh Agent integration  
- Test creating enemies and animated obstacles, general background characters, and “dependant” NPC sidekicks.

### Deliverables

**Reactor Based NPC Pack**
Drag and drop .unitypackages of interactive characters using the Mona Reactors. 
Customize your scene with one person, or a whole group using our asset pack.

Included below are instructions of how to add your own characters and animations to our fully customizable templates.

**Visual Scripting NPC Pack**
Custom built visual scripted NPC templates by Boomboxheads. 
Utilize multiple styles of waypoint finding systems to add direction and purpose to how your characters move around the space.








**Develop NPC Templates**

- Create and test 2 different rigging types: humanoid, and custom rigged model
- Generate 4+ low poly custom 3D models - fully textured and rigged.
- Compile resources on character templates and information on weight map transfers and more.
- Develop custom animation sequences and compile resources for animation presets.
- Create a collection of animations for NPCs: Idle, walk, run, misc behaviors
- Test VRM imports and techniques for easily utilizing your VRM designs as NPCs.

**Create an NPC Community Asset Pack**

- All model templates will be preset with a bank of interactive features/animations using the animator and Reactor (idle>interaction1>interaction2>idle)
- Written instructions and inventory of how to customize the Unity Package/Reactor/VS templates
- Animated Humanoid NPC
    - Asset pack with 1-2 ready-made humanoid characters
    - Rigged, fully textured
    - Inventory of compatible animations
- Animated robot custom-rigged NPC
    - Asset pack with 1-2 ready-made robot characters
    - Rigged, fully textured
    - Inventory of compatible animations

**Written tutorials on each step of the process**

- Character modeling/ Rigging
- Animating and importing animations in Blender
- Importing and optimizing for Unity
- Utilizing the Unity Animator, VRM and Reactor tools
- Importing into Mona Space and testing full functions
